<h1>Nmap Scanner</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we will be developing a Python script designed to automate network scanning using Nmap. The objective is to construct a tool that can perform various types of network scans, helping to identify open ports and assess network security. This exercise serves as an essential introduction to network penetration testing, leveraging Python to control Nmap, thus enhancing network diagnostic capabilities and understanding the intricacies of network security protocols. <br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>
- <b>Microsoft Visual Studio</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b> 

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

- <b>Development and Enhancement of Network Scanning Tools</b>: Successfully developed a Python script that integrates with Nmap to automate complex network scans. This project demonstrated proficiency in using Python for network interaction, including crafting scans that provide detailed insights into network security and topology. It allowed for a deeper understanding of how to utilize scripting to automate and customize network diagnostics tasks.

- <b>Practical Network Security Assessment</b>: Gained hands-on experience in using automated tools to simulate penetration testing activities, which is crucial for network security assessments. This project highlighted the importance of understanding network vulnerabilities and the role of systematic scanning in identifying potential security risks, thereby enhancing the capability to devise more robust network security measures.


<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
When beginning you will be prompted to enter in an IP address, for this example I used my private network IP, with confirmation of it running circled in blue down below and for the rest of the other scans. After putting in the IP, you will be given three different scan options to choose from, once selected Nmap will begin the scan, resulting in an output of: <br/>
